# 🧩 Power BI Agentic Plugins

Plugins that turn GitHub Copilot into a specialist for Power BI and Microsoft Fabric development. Built for [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli) and [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), also compatible with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 📦 Plugins

| Plugin                           | What it does                                                                                                                      | 
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| **[powerbi](./plugins/powerbi)** | Create semantic models, author reports in PBIR, write DAX queries, explore published datasets, apply modeling best practices, and **optimize reports for Report Copilot pane readiness**. | 
| **[fabric](./plugins/fabric)**   | Navigate workspaces, import/export item definitions, call Fabric & Power BI REST APIs, run jobs, and manage OneLake files.        |

Every plugin follows the same structure:

```
plugin-name/
├── .claude-plugin/plugin.json   # Manifest
├── .mcp.json                    # Tool connections
├── agents/                      # Agent personas with role-specific instructions
└── skills/                      # Domain knowledge Copilot draws on automatically
```

- **Skills** encode domain expertise, best practices, command references, and step-by-step workflows. Copilot draws on them automatically when relevant.
- **Agents** define personas with specific responsibilities (e.g., a Power BI architect vs. developer) and declare which skills and tools to use.
- **Connectors** wire Copilot to external tools — the Fabric CLI and Power BI Modeling MCP — via [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

**These plugins are starting points.** They become much more useful when you customize them for how your team actually works:

- **Add company context** — Add your naming conventions, workspace structure, and modeling patterns into skill files so Copilot understands your world.
- **Adjust workflows** — Modify skill instructions to match how your team does things (e.g., your deployment pipeline, your BPA rules).
- **Swap connectors** — Edit `.mcp.json` to point at your specific MCP servers.
  
## 🚀 Getting Started

Select your AI assistant and install the plugin or skills directly within it.

### GitHub Copilot CLI Setup

- Install [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli)
- Open Copilot and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    # Open GitHub Copilot CLI
    copilot

    # Add the marketplace (one-time setup)
    /plugin marketplace add RuiRomano/powerbi-agentic-plugins

    # Install plugins
    /plugin install powerbi@powerbi-agentic-plugins
    /plugin install fabric@powerbi-agentic-plugins

    # Restart Copilot to activate
    ```

Once installed, plugins activate automatically. Skills fire when relevant — for example, asking Copilot to create a semantic model automatically pulls in the `powerbi-semantic-model` skill.

### Visual Studio Code Setup

- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install [GitHub Copilot Chat extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
- Enable [Agent Skills](vscode://settings/chat.useAgentSkills) and [Use Skill Adherence Prompt](vscode://settings/chat.experimental.useSkillAdherencePrompt) in user settings (Ctrl+,)
- Follow [discover and install plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-plugins#_discover-and-install-plugins) to install this plugin in VS Code.
- Optionally, you can also clone/download this repo and manually setup in your workspac
    - Copy the skills you want from the downloaded plugin repo (e.g. `plugins\powerbi\skills`) to `.github/skills` 

        Your folder structure should look like this:

        ```text
        Folder/
        ├── .github/
        │   └── skills/
        │       └── powerbi-semantic-model/
        │           └── SKILL.md
        ├── ...
        ```

        See [GitHub Agent Skills documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/agent-skills) for more information where you can configure skills with VS Code.


## ✨ What's New: Report Copilot Pane Optimization

This fork adds the **prep-powerbi-for-report-copilot** skill to the powerbi plugin. Optimize your Power BI reports and semantic models so the Report Copilot pane reliably answers questions using existing visuals.

### 5-Step Workflow
1. 📋 **Report Usage Inventory** — Document which fields each visual uses
2. 🎯 **AI Data Schema** — Design what Copilot should and shouldn't see
3. 💬 **AI Instructions** — Teach Copilot your business terminology
4. 📊 **Answer Pack** — Create visuals that Copilot will reference
5. ✅ **Test & Iterate** — Validate and refine Copilot behavior

### Example Prompt
```bash
# Prompt:
    Optimize my Power BI report for Copilot readiness
    
    Report path: C:\projects\portfolio-analysis\
    Business domain: Portfolio performance tracking for asset managers
    Top questions: ["What's the portfolio balance by state?", "Show me top 10 delinquencies", ...]
    Sensitive fields: SSN, taxpayer ID
```

See [prep-powerbi-for-report-copilot skill](plugins/powerbi/skills/prep-powerbi-for-report-copilot/README.md) for full details and workflow.


## 📊 Scenarios

### New Direct Lake semantic model on top of Lakehouse tables

```
# 1. Create a Lakehouse in Microsoft Fabric
# 2. Load it with some sample data, e.g. Retail sample data
# 3. Prompt:
    Create a new direct lake semantic model in workspace [workspace] that uses the tables from lakehouse [lakehouse]
```

### Semantic Model on top of CSV data

```
# Prompt:
    Create a new semantic model based on the CSV files located in `https://github.com/RuiRomano/powerbi-agentic-plugins/tree/main/assets/sample-data` use Power Query HTTP connector. Apply standard modeling best practices throughout (e.g., proper relationships, naming conventions, data types, and star schema design).
    After creating the semantic model, create a Power BI report on top of it.
```

### Align Report visuals

- Save a report as PBIP
- Close Desktop
- Open the PBIP using Copilot CLI
- Run the prompt
- Reopen PBIP in Power BI Desktop

```
# Prompt:
    Align the Power BI report visuals in the PBIR folder `Path to the PBIP *.Report\ folder`
    
```

### Spec driven development

- Create a Fabric workspace
- Using the [powerbi-architect](plugins/powerbi/agents/powerbi-architect.agent.md) agent
- Run the prompt below
- Using the [powerbi-developer](plugins/powerbi/agents/powerbi-developer.agent.md) agent ask to implement the spec created by the architect agent

Prompt:
```
## Goals

- Work in Fabric workspace: '[Workspace name]'
- I want to create a new Power BI semantic model with name 'SM_Sales_GitHub'
- CSV files are in the URL: https://github.com/RuiRomano/powerbi-agentic-plugins/tree/main/assets/sample-data
- **Business requirements:**
  - I want to see the total sales amount so that I can understand revenue performance.
  - I want to understand the taxes impact
  - I want to see year-over-year and month-over-month sales growth percentages  
- Ensure my **Team modeling guidelines are respected**. See [team-modeling-rules.md](assets/team-modeling-rules.md)
- **Before implementation create a spec for review**
  
## Expectations

- Model deployed to the Fabric workspace
- Model should be refreshed 
- Measures return expected results with acceptable performance

## Other
- When analysing CSV files from GitHub don't use the fetch_webpage. Download the files locally to a temp folder (`temp/`) and analyze the top ~50 rows without loading the entire file to LLM context window.
    
```
